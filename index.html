  In this article I will be talking about Deforestations

  <li class="bold-line">Deforestation is defined as cutting down forests to clear the land, for the making of materials,
    or for other use </li>

  <h2>Why Deforestation is Harmful:</h2>

  factors of climate. In the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/deforestation-and-forest-degradation">World
    Wild Life</a> website it
  talks about how Forests are a vital role in mitigating climate change because they act as a carbon sink—soaking up
  carbon dioxide that would otherwise be free in the atmosphere and contribute to ongoing changes in climate
  patterns.
  Therefore, by elimating the amount of trees we are increasing the amount of carbon dioxide we leave in the planet
  and that can make a negative impact to our atomosphere which will increase climate change.</p>

    <h3> Deforestations Affects on Global Warming</h3>

  <p> Deforestation increases global warming drastically. In the website <a
      href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/whats-redd-and-will-it-help-tackle-climate-change/#:~:text=Forests%20and%20trees%20store%20carbon,contribute%20to%20climate%20change%EF%BB%BF%20.">The
      London School of Ecomnomic and Political Science</a> it talks about how in the last decade, the largest amounts
    of
    deforestation occurred across the humid tropics. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that around
    129
    million hectares of forest – almost equivalent to the area of South Africa – were lost between 1990 and 2015.</p>

    <h3> Deforestation Affects on Animals</h3>

  <p>Deforestation takes away the homes of poor animals who are just trying to live. It not only takes their homes but
    it
    can leave them open to predatory species that they won't usually encounter if not to deforestation. These animals
    are
    put into situations they shouldn't be put in because humans are cutting down their homes. This article <a
      href="https://standfortrees.org/blog/deforestation-effects-on-animals/#:~:text=Deforestation%20affects%20animals%20in%20many,the%20main%20causes%20of%20extinction.">Death
      in the Forest</a> talks about the negative affects of taking away these animals habitats from them for our greed.
